Hello Kelly!

Your logrotate file is absolutely beautiful! So much detail! Couldn't have done that better myself because that is absolutely brilliant. great work on creating, extracting, compressing, and managing tar backup archives! You were able to extract the Tardocs, create a Javaless archive, and make sure that Java/ is not located in the new archive. You also provided a critical analysis explanation about -x versus -c and not to mention, that part is also extremely detailed.

You're amazing and I can't wait to see what else you do.
